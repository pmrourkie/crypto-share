	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>Here you can import a file, encrypt (or decrypt!) and then download an ecrypted copy of it so you can the safely share - or store - it! It's pretty simple, it uses the crypto.js libary and 256 bit encryption using the the AES algorythm. It does all of the encryption/decrpytion locally without anything being uploaded to a server, meaning your file isn't being sent across the internet.
	</p>
	<p>All you need to do is click either encrypy or decrypt and then upload your file. If you want to encrypt your file then just enter a 7 charcter length phrase and download an ecrypted copy. <strong>Important! You'll need to remember that phrase to decrypt the file!</strong> If you want to decypt the file, then you - or a friend - will need to come to this site and click the decrypt button, import your file and enter the phrase that was used to encrypt it.</p>
	<p>To use this site you'll need to be connected to the internet, but because it's built using HTML & Javascript you can dow.
